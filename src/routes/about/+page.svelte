        <p>
            A human being whose personality has been permanently overwritten by
            Type-Moon lore. Thinks about Fate at least 12 times a day, measures
            morality using Servant alignments, and believes every life problem
            can be solved with a Noble Phantasm and enough mana. Has strong
            opinions about routes, will start a war over which Saber is
            superior, and casually drops “Actually in the Nasuverse—” into
            normal conversations. Brain is 90% Holy Grail Wars, 10% coping. If
            reality disagrees with Fate canon, reality is wrong.
